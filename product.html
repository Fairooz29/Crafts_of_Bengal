            <p style="font-size:1.01rem;line-height:1.7;color:#3d332a;">Nakshi Kantha, a traditional embroidery craft from Bangladesh and parts of West Bengal, India, has a rich history dating back centuries. Originating in rural Bengal, it was primarily practiced by women in households to create quilts, wraps, and other textiles from discarded fabrics. The name 'Nakshi Kantha' is derived from 'naksha,' meaning artistic patterns, and 'kantha,' referring to the quilted cloth. These intricate embroideries often depict scenes from daily life, folklore, and nature, showcasing the artistic skills and cultural heritage of the region.</p>
